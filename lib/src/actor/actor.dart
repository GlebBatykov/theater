/// Class contains four methods which symbolize its life cycle:
///
/// [onStart] - method is called after actor started (after him [Isolate] started).
///
/// [onKill] - method is called before actor will killed (before him [Isolate] will killed).
///
/// [onPause] - method is called before actor will paused (before him [Isolate] will paused).
///
/// [onResume] - method is called after actor resumed (after him [Isolate] resumed).
///
/// All of the above methods return [Future]. Once [Future] completed actor sends successful event to him supervisor.
///
/// Therefore, it is important not to wait indefinitely for anything in these methods  asynchronously.
