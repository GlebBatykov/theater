// the exception by passing the error to an upstream actor.
//
// However, in this example we will create our own decider, our own supervisor strategy,
// and if the exception we handle is FormatException we will pause the work of the actor.
//
// After an exception occurs in an actor. If [stopAfterError] field of supervisor strategy is true -
// its work will be paused before it supervisor actor decides what needs to be done with it.
// The method onPause of the actor in which the exception was thrown will be triggered.
//
// Supervisor actor (FirstTestActor) with the help of TestDecider will decide that the actor in which the exception occurred needs to be paused.
// If an actor was suspended after throwing an exception before a decision was made, then it will remain paused.
